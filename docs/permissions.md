# Permissions
The bot needs these permissions to function. You can give them server-wide when inviting the bot, or use category/channel permissions (see the [Discord documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ#h_01FFTVZWZVQ3BZ0ZXRJ1QBCKY1)).

* View Channel ( &gt;.&gt; )
* Manage Channel (to overwrite the channel topic)
* Send Messages (to send alerts)
* Attach Files (to send renders with the alerts)
* Manage Messages (for the overview channel, to delete the "bottom griefs" list)
